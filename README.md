# Launch-Guid-Generator

This is a simple plugin that just launches the Guid Gen tool that ships with Visual Studio. If for some reason you see that the option for Guid Gen is missing from your Tools menu then you can use this extension =)

The extension is published on Visual Gallery so you can install it from https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e6af82fd-1ce6-49bb-bc3a-1b9d1374c24b.

Currently it is hardcoded to run C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\Tools\guidgen.exe so if this doesn't exist for some reason on your machine you won't be able to use this extension.
